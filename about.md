My name is Alexey.


I'm a first-year Ph.D. student from ITMO University (Saint Petersburg, Russia).

I'm a linux/archlinux, C/C++/Qt/QML, Python/Ruby, KDE fan.
Happy [Jolla SailfishOS smartphone](https://sailfishos.org/) and [Pebble Time smartwatch](https://www.pebble.com/) owner.

I'm currently working on [SemIoT project](https://github.com/semiotproject) at [ISST lab](http://isst.ifmo.ru/en/).

And also trying to implement [Pebble Time smartwatch mobile application for Jolla SailfishOS](https://github.com/a-andreyev/sinker).

I plan to revive The Semantic Desktop project for KDE.
