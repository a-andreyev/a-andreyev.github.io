## About

[The blog](http://aa13q.ru/) is about my interests, Qt/Sailfish/Archlinux-related mostly I guess.

## API 

## Jekyll Theme

The theme is based on Darcli.

That theme is intended to use to [lampiaosec website](https://lampiaosec.github.io) and after was converted to a general theme to jekyll.

So, any questions, can you contact ([@gjuniioor](https://github.com/gjuniioor)) or open a [issue](https://github.com/gjuniioor/darcli/issuesi).

This theme is under [GPL3](assets/LICENSE).
