## About

My name is Alexey.

![photo](assets/img/aa13q.jpeg)

I'm a software engineer from Saint Petersburg, Russia.

I'm interested mostly in open-source solutions for resource-constrained devices: operating systems, middleware, client applications. These words are not an empty phrase for me:

+ GNU/Linux/Arch Linux/Manjaro/Alpine/pmOS
+ C/C++/Qt/QML/KDE
+ Sailfish OS/Aurora OS/KDE
+ multimedia
+ AI/semantic web/ontologies

Apart from things, directly related to cybernetics, I (poorly) try to broaden my horizons in:

+ cultural studies
+ media studies
