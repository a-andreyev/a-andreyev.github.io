[Listen to The Soundmaker by Rodrigo y Gabriela at Bandcamp][0].
And read a little about the song and the band.

You probably have heard about [Rodrigo y Gabriela][1] band from Breaking Bad [TV Series][2] OST (I have at least).

In spite of awesome [Tamacun][3] song (as I [understood][4] Tamacun is the name of some Mexican guy who hunting and taking care of crocodiles) and very nice [Chac Mool][5] song, there is some great new one from their “9 Dead Alive” album: The Soundmaker.
This song is dedicated to [Antonio Torres Jurado][6], who was:

> a Spanish guitarist and luthier, and “the most important Spanish guitar maker of the 19th century.”

> *And he was born on June, 13th as me! :)*

[Interesting] [7] band, wish I could listen to some of their best songs live someday.
