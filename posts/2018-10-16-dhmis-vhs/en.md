# DHMIS VHS version 

I'm a huge fan of [Don't hug me I'm scared](http://beckyandjoes.com/dont-hug-me-im-scared/).

I've rewatched it this year again during making my conclusions about the show meaning.

I've [won](https://vk.com/diskettelounge?w=wall-108020125_2144) a [Diskette lounge](https://diskettelounge.com/) bar [competition](https://vk.com/wall-108020125_2035?w=wall-108020125_2035) at the same time recently. It was a random selection among their public comments at some russian advisors platform. The reward is an option to mount your VHS tape on [the wall of VHS tapes](https://vk.com/topic-108020125_39060948) (kind of place decor).

I've got an idea to record all the DHMIS episodes on a VHS tape and make a cover for it.

[Wakey-Wakey](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkFpNVxzhTs) trailer is also raised recently and I've got more enthusiasm.

I've bought old cheap VCR and VHS tapes at some russian flea e-market. I got rid from my CRT-TV recently, because it was broken and loud (didn't managed to fix it). But I have an LCD panel from an old laptop and LCD board controller from aliexpress with RCA AV-out support, and found all the needed RCA-cables and HDMI-AV converter to support hdmi video from my current laptop.

I've managed to build this kind of system:

I've found a VHS cover template and made DHMIS-styled cover by myself:

Here's the PSD-source and splitted 2xA4 pages print-ready PNG version:

I've printed the cover on a business card cardboard with maximum avaliable density at some print center, where they asked me to provide A4 version instead of A3. The result box is bigger a bit than regular one (didn't managed yet why), but it's not critical.

During video playing from laptop, I've used [arch linux](https://www.archlinux.org/), [KDE](https://www.kde.org/), [youtube-dl](http://rg3.github.io/youtube-dl/) and [mpv](https://mpv.io/), statring tracks locally on attached screen like:

	mpv --fs ./

I've recorded kickstarter tracks, 6 episodes and Wakey-Wakey trailer, and erased rest of the tape with "no signal" system image from hdmi2av converter.

I gifted a copy to a bar, where all the tapes have some marks. Since I'm not a hookah fan, I've wrote "hookah makes your teeth go grey" on my tape:

I've wrote to the authors via [twitter](https://twitter.com/a_andreyev/status/1045427296902033409) several [times](https://twitter.com/a_andreyev/status/1045437430541832194) and also via email, that I would like to send them a copy as a souvenir, but didn't received any feedback yet.
