# Against the war

A message from an open-source contributor from Russia. I am against the war.

I'm not ready to leave my family and relatives. I'm going to stay here in Russia and do my best against the war.
For example, here're some open letters from the science and IT community in Russia against it:

- science: https://trv-science.ru/2022/02/we-are-against-war-all/
- IT community: https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScEsxsoXl_7R4aD5F8-B7fCCBVwU_BXBaOVJsKszbFyRHRkkw/viewform?fbclid=IwAR0avN8mDxT0fLZxBe26YnE3xZARnuwMT5jdP0jNeweItEMbmVzvzd_C41Q

I'm not asking to sign my Russian colleagues, we all understand it's not that simple in terms of actions.

For me, it's not about just one evil person, a lot of forces involved. I have zero real info (not talking about the media nobody trust). I'm in touch with open source contributors and creators from Ukraine to hear are they safe. Please, be in touch directly with people.

Communication is very important.

P.S.: (8 march update) In this war of all against all, I cannot stand in solidarity with everyone indiscriminately simply due to the anti-war agenda. I also cannot accept the pro-military positions even of those whose values are partially close to me in other areas. I'm trying not to use all these like-repost-focused platforms anymore and trying to communicate with people directly.
